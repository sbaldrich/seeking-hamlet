# Seeking Hamlet

Quick and dirty implementation of a word-indexed representation of The Tragedy of Hamlet to support fast queries of fragments
of the play only by using a single term. See the accompanying blog post for this repo [here](https://blog.sbaldrich.dev/posts/2021-03-23-new-post-seeking-hamlet-part-i).

## How to Run

For now, just compile and run the main (and only) source file.
